# Quadratic primes
#
# Considering quadratics of the form:
#
#     nÂ² + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
#
# Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic
# expression that produces the maximum number of primes for
# consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.

# When n = 0, p(0) = b, hence b prime
